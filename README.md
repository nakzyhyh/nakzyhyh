### Current Projects

- **Diagnostic Tooling:**  
  Integrating various system and network diagnostic logics into a cohesive Flask-based solution.

- **Static File Management:**  
  Ensuring CSS/JS are served securely to eliminate file:// and CORS issues.

- **Single-App Architecture:**  
  Streamlining deployments by consolidating routes and managing a single Flask instance rather than multiple scattered apps.

- **Web Crawler:**  
  I'm currently developing a recursive web crawler that navigates through product detail pages and configuration sections (such as Configure and Order) on websites. The crawler extracts all relevant product information, including specifications, prices, and configuration options. It consolidates this data into a structured PDF document for easy review and documentation. The focus is on automating data collection from complex, multi-layered web structures and presenting it in a clear, accessible format. The solution is built using Python, leveraging libraries like BeautifulSoup for parsing and FPDF for generating the final reports.

## 🌍 My Vision

🚀 **Leverage AI** to create ethical & impactful innovations.  
🎨 **Combine technical expertise** with creativity to solve real-world problems.  
🤝 **Collaborate with visionary teams** to shape the digital future.
